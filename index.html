With a raspy chuckle, a twinkle in his eyes and a fearless joie de vivre, Philippe “Pipo” Salomon, waltzed through life at his own pace…even throughout his battle with kidney disease that ultimately took his life. 
 
So, who was this charmant?  Philippe was born in Port-Au-Prince, to Georges and Adeline (Georges) Salomon on August 15, 1954. He was a bright child and ultimately enrolled in medical school in Mexico City, Mexico. There he forged lifelong friendships, that reverberate through the family even today. Truth is, anyone who’s met Philippe, was instantly aware they’ve met someone special. He was caring, loving, passionate, and empathetic.  These qualities led him to found a beloved orphanage in Diquini with his partner Marie-Carmel. 

Philippe was a devoted father, a loving grandfather, a loyal brother, and an endearing uncle. But he wore other hats too, he was our mother when our moms were not around. He was our doctor when we bruised and ached. He was our teacher when the world seemed incomprehensible. He was our story teller when life seemed bleak. 

Philippe, affectionately; Papi, Papi -Philippe, Pipo, Padrino, Chief, and Grandpa, is survived by his amazing partner: Marie-Carmel Franck. His loving children: Phillip (Alusi) Solomon, Adrien (Jasmin) Salomon, Alexandre Salomon, Arielle Born Salomon (Christopher) Griffin, Pascal (Gabrielle) Salomon, Dominique Salomon, Richard Salomon, and the children of the orphanage: La Maison des Petits De Diquini. He is also survived by his sisters and brother: Guillaine Salomon Freeman, Pascale, Jean-Bernard and Nathalie Salomon. His aunt, Claudette Salomon, his uncle Jacques (Juliette) Salomon, as well as beloved cousins, nieces, nephews, in-laws, and dear friends, including the Salomons, the Pierres, the McAfees, the Ergas, the Brunos, the Bivins, the Mathieus, the Bolieres, the Labbés, the Francks, the Jean-Gilles, the Latortues, the Samsons, the Freemans, the Casimirs, the Coicouxs, the Jean-Baptistes, the Beausejours, and the Martinos and many other close family members and friends who will miss him dearly.

His daughter, Arielle, reminisces, "My father was a light in our family and the world. He was always there for us, always ready with a hug or a joke, and always giving of himself. He will be deeply missed, but his love and spirit will live on."
